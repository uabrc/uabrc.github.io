# Researcher Facing Documentation

Hi there!

If you're reading this, then you've found the repository of documentation supporting the University of Alabama at Birmingham's (UAB) Research Computing group, a part of UAB IT.

It is our mission to serve and support the UAB Research Community with all of their research computing and data needs.

If you are here looking for the actual documentation, please go to <https://docs.rc.uab.edu>. You can find information on our Office Hours, how to get support for our services and platforms, and more!

We welcome contributions! If you'd like to contribute to our documentation, please visit our [Contributor Guide](https://docs.rc.uab.edu/contributing/contributor_guide/).
