# 2026-03-15 Maintenance - Code.rc (GitLab) Host Migration

Code.rc (the Research Computing GitLab service) will be unavailable from Friday, 2026-03-13 at 5:00 PM, through Sunday, 2026-03-15 at 11:59 PM, for planned maintenance. We expect to finish before the end of the window but have reserved the duration due to the nature of the changes.

<!-- more -->

Two changes are being made.

1. The Enterprise IT - Infrastructure team is changing the VM platform hosting Code.rc.
1. The Code.rc VM OS is being upgraded.

This maintenance will enable Research Computing to upgrade GitLab beyond the current version. We appreciate your patience as we make this important change.
