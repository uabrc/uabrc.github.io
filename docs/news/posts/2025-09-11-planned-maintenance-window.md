# 2025-09-11 Planned Maintenance Window

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
!!! note

    This window applies only to researchers using GPFS5.
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD046 -->

We will be performing upgrades on the GPFS5 storage system to optimize stability. During this process, researchers on the GPFS5 side will be unable to login via SSH, and Open OnDemand (<https://rc.uab.edu>) will appear unresponsive.

The maintenance window is scheduled for the morning of Tuesday, September 16, 2025, from 6:00 AM through 6:00 PM. We expect the process to take no more than 12 hours. We will restore service as soon as work is complete.
