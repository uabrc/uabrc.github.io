# UAB Research Computing Day

Research Computing Day is a dialog within the UAB research communityabout leveraging the power of computers to grow the depth of our investigation into the nature of the world that surrounds us. The annual event welcomes discussions on science, engineering, the arts and humanities focused on the drive to open new research frontiers with advances in technology.

Whether computers are used to increase the accuracy of a model, interpret the ever-growing stream of data from new image collections and instruments, or engage with peers around the globe, UAB's status as a leading research community depends on the ability to incorporate these capabilities into the research process. By participating in the dialog of Research Computing Day at UAB, researchers can share how they are using these methods to enhance their research, gain new insights from peers, and contribute their voices to the growth of research at UAB.

## Background

Since 2007, The [Office of the Vice President for Information Technology](https://www.uab.edu/it/home) has sponsored an annual dialog on the role of technology in research. These events joined UAB with [national dialogs on the role of Cyberinfrastructure in research](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0956272) held at campuses across the country.
