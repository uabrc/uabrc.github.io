# Welcome to UAB Research Computing

The Research Computing System (RCS) provides a framework for sharing research data, accessing computing power, and collaborating with peers on campus and around the globe. We have deployed a dynamic "network of services" to facilitate organizing, studying, and sharing research data.

## About Us

Research Computing is developed and supported by UAB IT's Research Computing Group. We are developing a core set of applications to help you easily incorporate our services into your research processes and this documentation collection to help you leverage the resources already available. We follow the best practices of the Open Source community and develop our software in an open-source fashion.

Research Computing is an out growth of the UABgrid pilot, launched in September 2007 which has focused on demonstrating the utility of unlimited analysis, storage, and application for research. RCS is built on the same technology foundations used by major cloud vendors and decades of distributed systems computing research, technology that powered the last ten years of large scale systems serving prominent national and international initiatives like the [Open Science Grid](https://osg-htc.org/), [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/), the [LHC Computing Grid](https://wlcg.web.cern.ch/), and [NCIP](https://datascience.cancer.gov/).

### About Our Service Level

Research Computing is centrally funded by UAB for 5-by-8 support (5 days per week, 8 hours per day), offered between the hours of 8:00 AM and 5:00 PM, every Monday through Friday, except for [UAB Designated Holidays](https://www.uab.edu/humanresources/home/benefits/time-off/holidays).

Our services and platforms average 98% uptime, substantially higher than NSF requirements. If your research efforts require higher service, or if extended maintenance periods are not acceptable, the we are happy to work with you to explore commercial cloud services. Please [Contact Us](./help/support.md).

All technology services must find an appropriate operating point, trading off among availability, quality, and cost. Research computing trades availability for reduced cost, which means more resources for our researchers to use for scientific discovery. While commercial cloud services typically guarantee 99% or more uptime, NSF guidelines to fund "Advanced Computing Systems" requires 95% ([source](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/advanced-computing-systems-services-adapting-rapid-evolution/nsf24-583/solicitation), V.A.2.c "Resource Reliability and Usability"). UAB Research Computing has averaged 98% uptime, beating NSF guidelines substantially. In addition to our uptime and resources, we offer something not offered by commercial cloud services, nor some other research computing groups &mdash; a team of facilitators, developers, and operations experts dedicated to finding solutions for our research community.
