## Ways We Can Help

### UAB Research Computing Documentation

You can look through sections in our [documentation](../index.md) to answer many common questions you may have. You can also look up the various setup guides we have for the services we provide. We provide some step-by-step tutorials, troubleshooting tips, and examples to support your research workflow needs. For Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) please see our [FAQs page](./faq.md).

### Send a Support Ticket

Please reach out to us via email at <support@listserv.uab.edu> to create a support ticket. We address technical issues related to our Research Computing services, such as account management, data and storage needs, GPU usage, resource allocation and reservation, and cloud RC. We also provide limited support for research tools and software native to the platforms we provide or support. In the section [How do I Create a Support Ticket](./support.md#how-do-i-create-a-support-ticket) we provide a guide to help you capture useful information in drafting a support ticket.

### Attend Virtual Office Hours

You can also attend our virtual office hours on Mondays and Thursdays weekly. Our Research Facilitation team provides live support during these hours to resolve your needs. The meetings are held on Zoom. Times and URLs are available at our [How to Contact Us](../index.md#how-to-contact-us) section.
