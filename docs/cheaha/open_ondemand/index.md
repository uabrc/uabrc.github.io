title: Open OnDemand
---

Open OnDemand (OOD) is a user-friendly web interface for accessing
Cheaha and all of its associated software and tools without needing to
manage a person VNC session. It is currently the preferred method for
accessing Cheaha at UAB.

OOD is available at <https://rc.uab.edu>. Navigate there and
authenticate with your UAB credentials. Outside reseachers will need to
use XIAS. If you do not have a Cheaha account, you will be requested to
make one.
