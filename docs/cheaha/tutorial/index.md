# Cheaha Tutorials

## Conda on Cheaha

Python is a high level programming language that is widely used in many branches of science. As a result, many scientific packages have been developed in Python, leading to the development of a package manager called [`conda`](../../workflow_solutions/using_conda.md). `conda` is a widely used Python package manager for scientific research. Consequently `conda` is used on Cheaha for managing environments and packages.

Have you encountered problems while using `conda` on Cheaha? We have provided this page to curate a number of walkthroughs on how you can address majority of the needs you may have or challenges you may experience using `conda` on [Cheaha](../getting_started.md).

1. [Using Conda as part of parallel Slurm workflows](../slurm/slurm_tutorial.md).

## Using Slurm

[Slurm](../slurm/introduction.md) is the job scheduler used on [Cheaha](../getting_started.md) that manages which work runs on which resources. Jobs are created when researchers interact with Slurm to request resources on which to run their research software.
