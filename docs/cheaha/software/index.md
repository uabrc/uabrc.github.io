# How Do I Get Software on Cheaha

On Cehaha, many commonly used software applications are already installed and made available through the module system, which lets you easily load, unload, and switch between different versions as needed.

Depending on the software’s availability, installation method, and licensing requirements, there are several ways to access what you need. You can access software:

- [Preinstalled Module](modules.md) – software already available on the system through modules
- [Self-Installed Software](software.md) – software that you set up yourself, either using:
    - [Conda environments](software.md#anaconda-on-cheaha).
    - [Singularity Containers](software.md#software-installation).
