# Welcome

Welcome to the Research Computing System

The Research Computing System (RCS) provides a framework for sharing data, accessing compute power, and collaborating with peers on campus and around the globe. Our goal is to construct a dynamic "network of services" that you can use to organize your data, study it, and share outcomes.

The Research Computing System is designed to provide services to researchers in three core areas:

- _Data Analysis_: using the High Performance Computing (HPC) fabric we call Cheaha for analyzing data and running simulations. Many applications are already available or you can install your own
- _Data Sharing_: supporting the trusted exchange of information using virtual data containers to spark new ideas
- Application Development: providing virtual machines and web-hosted development tools empowering you to serve others with your research

## Support and Development

The Research Computing System is developed and supported by UAB IT's Research Computing Group. We are also developing a core set of applications to help you to easily incorporate our services into your research processes and this documentation collection to help you leverage the resources already available. We follow the best practices of the Open Source community and develop the RCS openly.

The Research Computing System is an out growth of the UABgrid pilot, launched in September 2007 which has focused on demonstrating the utility of unlimited analysis, storage, and application for research. RCS is being built on the same technology foundations used by major cloud vendors and decades of distributed systems computing research, technology that powered the last ten years of large scale systems serving prominent national and international initiatives like the [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/), [XSEDE](https://www.xsede.org/), the [LHC Computing Grid](https://wlcg.web.cern.ch/), and [NCIP](https://datascience.cancer.gov/).

## Outreach

The UAB IT Research Computing Group has collaborated with a number of prominent research projects at UAB to identify use cases and develop the requirements for the RCS. Our collaborators include the Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), Heflin Genomics Center, the Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC), the Department of Computer and Information Sciences (CIS), the Department of Mechanical Engineering (ME), Lister Hill Library, the School of Optometry's Center for the Development of Functional Imaging, and Health System Information
Services (HSIS).

As part of the process of building this research computing platform, the UAB IT Research Computing Group has hosted an annual campus symposium on research computing and cyber-infrastructure (CI) developments and accomplishments. Starting as CyberInfrastructure (CI) Days in 2007, the name was changed to `UAB Research Computing Day` in 2011 to reflect the broader mission to support research. IT Research Computing also participates in other campus wide symposiums including UAB Research Core Day.

## Data Backups

Researchers on Cheaha are solely responsible for backing up their files. This includes files under `/data/user`, `/data/project`, and `/home`. There is no automatic back up of any researcher data on the cluster in home, data, or scratch. For more information, please see `backups`.

## Personnel

UAB IT Research Computing currently maintains a support staff of 13 FTE staff and 6 interns lead by Ralph Zottola,the Assistant Vice President for Research Computing, and managed by John-Paul Robinson, HPC Architect Manager, and Blake Joyce, Data Science Manager. Laura Dabbs is the program coordinator.

Research Computing is made up of three teams:

- The Development Team with 4 FTE software developers
- The Operations Team with 3 FTE system analysts
- The Data Science Team with 3 FTE scientists and 6 intern positions.
