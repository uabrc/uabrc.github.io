# Home and User Data Directories

Each user of Cheaha is provided with dedicated storage space to support active research and analysis. While there are currently no data retention policies in place, these spaces are not intended for storing large data.

When you first log in to Cheaha, you are placed in your home directory ($HOME). This directory is intended for:

- Scripts and supporting files
- Software configuration files
- Toolboxes and environments (e.g., Anaconda environments, R packages, etc)

In contrast, the user data directory ($USER_DATA) is designed for storing:

- Data and results specific to your individual research projects
- Files accessible only to you

The combined storage quota for `$HOME` and `$USER_DATA` is 5â€¯TB. For larger data or intensive workflows, consider using [network scratch](./network_scratch.md) space or a [project directory](./project_directories.md) for storing, moving, and analyzing data.

## How Much Space Do I Have Left?

Use the command `quota-report` to see usage in `/data/user/$USER` and `/scratch/$USER`.

Quota reports are updated nightly, so they may be out of date if you move data around before running these commands.

    Running out of Cheaha Storage space? Can't afford to remove any data? Please consider using our [Long Term Storage (LTS) system](../lts/index.md).

## Policies & Expectations

This section outlines key storage policies and exceptions, including access control, data management, and conditions for administrative access or quota increases in user data and home directories.

- Storage Entitlement: All users receive a 5TB of default quota upon creating a Cheaha account.
- Quota Increase: At this time, we do not provide a quota increase in user data and home directories. If you require more storage for your work, please consider using [shared project allocation](./project_directories.md) or an [LTS](../../data_management/lts/index.md).
- Data Management: Users are responsible for organizing, cleaning, and backing up their data in their user data and home directory.
- Permission and Access Control Management: Access in user data and home directories can be managed using Access Control Lists (ACLs). Where third-party access is required, a security exception may apply. Please refer to the [Security Exception](../../data_management/research_data_responsibilities.md#security-exceptions-for-accessing-former-uab-personnel-data) page for more details.
- HIPAA Compliance: Users data and home directories are HIPAA compliant and can accept Protected Health Information (PHI) data. For HIPAA Compliance and UAB policies surrounding PHI data, please refer the [HIPAA Compliance](../../data_management/index.md#hipaa-compliance)page.
