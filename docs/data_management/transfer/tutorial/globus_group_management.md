# Globus Group Management

Organizations can manage students, staff, collaborators, and customers in Globus using the Group feature. Representatives can create groups and subgroups to manage and document associations between related people. With a Group, you can grant access to a Guest Collection to many people at once.

If you are new to Globus, we recommend starting with our [Globus Tutorials for Individual Researchers](./globus_individual_tutorial.md) first to familiarize yourself with how Globus is used.

    - **(2) Description** (optional): Describe the purpose and scope of the group here.
    - **(3) Terms & Conditions** (optional): should not be necessary for UAB groups.
    - **(4) Enable High Assurance** checkbox: Check if your group will deal with PHI, HIPAA, or other protected data.
    - **(5) Users may request to join this group** checkbox: Uncheck to make the group invite-only. Core administrators should consider leaving this box checked for their top-level group to avoid work filtering invitations and reduce noise.
    - **(6) Signup Fields** buttons: First Name, Last Name, and Organization are always required. We recommend also selecting "Project", "Department", and "Field of Science". Feel free to select any fields you wish.
    - **(7) Group Visibility** radio buttons: Click "Members of this Group" to hide the group from non-members.
    - **(8) Membership Visibility** radio buttons: Click "Administrators and Managers Only" to hide member names from each other.

## How Do I Create a Subgroup?

Subgroups are also full-fledged groups that happen to have a parent-child relationship with another group. Specifically, subgroups have a parent, and the subgroup is a child of the parent group. As a consequence, all members of the child subgroup are also members of the parent group. Subgroups may also have subgroups of their own. Otherwise, subgroups behave like any other group.
