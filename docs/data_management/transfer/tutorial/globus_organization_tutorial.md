# Globus Tutorials for UAB Research Organizations

This tutorial is designed to guide UAB research managers, such as Lab PIs, Core Directors, and their management staff, to help them set up and use Globus Connect Personal (GCP) for secure data sharing on their local/personal computers. GCP allows you to share data with collaborators efficiently meeting security and compliance standards for file sharing.

If you are new to Globus, we recommend starting with our [Globus Tutorials for Individual Researchers](./globus_individual_tutorial.md) first to familiarize yourself with how Globus is used. When those are complete, we then recommend following the tutorials on this page in order from start to finish, as later tutorials assume the previous tutorials have been completed.

## Why Globus?

Globus is a data transfer ecosystem that simplifies the process of transferring, sharing, and managing large datasets. It is used by research institutions around the world to move research data between different storage devices, computer systems, and institutions. Globus has many research data oriented features, making it ideal for many research data transfer scenarios. Below is a list of features.

- Straight-forward, browser-based interface.
- Compatible with [Long-Term Storage](../../lts/index.md).
- Can be used to share data with Research Core customers.
- Can be used to transfer data between lab workstations, servers, and Cheaha.
- Transfers are automatically retried in the event of network or computer system outages.
- Transfers are encrypted end-to-end. Globus never sees your data.
- Suitable for transferring PHI and HIPAA data. Note: a UAB Enterprise IT risk assessment is required.

## How Does Globus Work?

Globus is an ecosystem of software intended to make research data transfer simpler. The Globus Web Application (Web App) at <https://app.globus.org> allows you to initiate transfers between any two Collections you have authorization to access. The Globus Connect Personal (GCP) and Globus Connect Server (GCS) software let you turn any computer into a Globus Collection. At no point do Globus servers touch your research data. Instead, when you initiate a transfer between two Collections, the Globus application tells the two Collections that they need to talk to each other and data is sent directly between them. The Collections update the application with information you may need to know, such as how much data has transferred so far, how fast the transfer is proceeding, and any errors that occur. If the connection between Collections is interrupted for any reason, the Globus application will attempt to restart the transfer from where it left off.

## Tutorial Prerequisites

For these tutorials, you will need your BlazerID or [XIAS ID](../../../account_management/xias/index.md) and password to authenticate using UAB Single Sign-On (SSO).

## How Do I Get Onto the Globus Web App?

To learn how to get onto the Globus Web App [Globus Tutorials for Individual Researchers Page](./globus_individual_tutorial.md#how-do-i-get-onto-the-globus-web-app). Please visit that link and then return here when you have finished.

## How Do I Install Globus Connect Personal?

Globus Connect Personal (GCP) is available to install on the following Operating Systems. Linux is also available, but we do not cover the installation process here. If you need to install GCP on Linux, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.globus.org/globus-connect-personal/install/linux/).

Managing data for a Research Core? Please stop here. You should know that Globus Connect Personal is _not_ suitable for production use with customers. Please [Contact Support](../../../help/support.md#how-do-i-create-a-support-ticket) to discuss setting up Globus Connect Server for your Research Core.

Representing a lab? Globus Connect Personal may be suitable for your use case. If you transfer data infrequently, or transfer small amounts of data, then GCP is probably sufficient. If you frequently transfer large amounts of data, then Globus Connect Server can enable higher data transfer rates through parallelization. Please [Contact Support](../../../help/support.md) if you want to discuss installation of Globus Connect Server.

1. Right-click the icon to open the context menu and click "Options...".

    ![Context menu of Globus system tray icon showing options.](./images/go-choose-folder/win/002-context-menu.png)

1. A new window will appear with a tab labelled Access. In the Access tab is an interface to configure folders available on your GCP Collection. For most use cases, you should not check the writeable checkbox. Below is a summary of what each part of the menu does.

   - **(1) Accessible Folders** table with Folder, Shareable and Writeable columns. Any folder listed here will appear on your GCP Collection. Your research data folder or directories must be listed here to be shareable.
   - **(2) Shareable** column checkboxes controlling which folders can be shared with other users. Each of your research data directories must have this checkbox ticked to be shareable from the Collection. **Check this box only if you want to share your data with others.**
   - **(3) Writeable** column checkboxes controlling which folders can be written to by other users. If a folder is shared with other users, then they will be able to add, delete, or change the contents. We recommend against ticking these boxes for Research Cores serving data to customers. **Check this box only if you want others to be able to change your data.**
   - **(4) Plus `+` and minus `-` buttons** that allow you to add or remove folders from the list.
   - **(5) Save** button which saves changes made to this tab of the options.

    ![Access tab of GCP options menu showing the default settings.](./images/go-choose-folder/win/003-access-tab-default.png)

1. Use the plus `+` and minus `-` buttons to add your research data folders and remove other folders, as needed. Click the "Shareable" checkbox next to each research data folder. Click "Save" when finished.

    In this example, we removed the default `C:/Users/%username%/Documents` folder with the minus `-` button and added the `D:/data` folder with the `+` button and check the "Shareable" box. You will want to pick the folder where your research data is stored.

    ![Access tab of GCP options menu showing new settings.](./images/go-choose-folder/win/004-access-tab-changed.png)

1. Click the "General" tab. The "General" tab enables you to control some settings for the application itself and which folder is the default folder. The default folder will be the first one shown when accessing the Collection.

   - **(1) Run when Windows starts** checkbox enabling starting Globus Connect Personal when you start Windows. **Check this box if GCP should always be on when the computer is on.**
   - **(2) Home Folder** text field that lets you choose which folder will be the default folder for your Collection. We recommend setting this to your primary shared folder from the previous step to simplify navigating your Collection in the Globus Web App.
   - **(3) Save** button which saves changes made to this tab of the options. Be sure to click "Save" if you make changes here.

    ![General tab of GCP options menu showing default settings.](./images/go-choose-folder/win/005-general-tab-default.png)

1. Check "Run when Windows starts" if needed. Change the "Home Folder" to match your research data folder. Click "Save" when done.

    In this example, we set the "Home Folder" to match the research data folder, `D:/data` we added in a previous step. If you have multiple research directories to share, you will need to choose just one for this field. Be sure to click save when you are done.

    ![General tab of GCP options menu](./images/go-choose-folder/win/006-general-tab-changed.png)

## How Do I Enable Collection Sharing for My Globus Account?

Before you can share Collections from your Globus Connect Personal (GCP) Collection with others, you must do a one-time setup for your account. You will need to join the "University of Alabama at Birmingham (HA)" (UAB HA) subscription group. Sharing any Collection requires a paid subscription with Globus. UAB Research Computing has a subscription, but Globus does not know your BlazerID is part of our subscription until you join the subscription group. So, Globus also does not know the GCP Collection you created is part of our subscription. By joining our UAB HA group, you and your GCP Collection are confirmed to be part of our subscription, and you can share Collections from the GCP Collection.

To join the UAB HA group, we need to receive both a UAB support request, and a request to join the UAB HA group within the Globus Web App. We need both because we sometimes get spam applications through Globus. Having a Support Request helps us filter the spam. Please use the following steps to join.

1. Submit a [Support Request](../../../help/support.md#how-do-i-create-a-support-ticket). In the request please include the following.

    - Your BlazerID.
    - The text "Please add me to the Globus UAB HA subscription group."
    - The reason you need to be able to share a Collection in Globus. For Research Cores, this would be to share data with your customers.

1. In your browser [get onto the Globus Web App](#how-do-i-get-onto-the-globus-web-app).
1. In the left hand navigation panel click "Groups" to be taken to the Groups page.

    ![Globus groups page with no groups.](./images/go-uab-ha-group-access/001-groups-page.png)

1. Ensure the "MY GROUPS" box is unchecked. In the "Filter groups" search bar enter "University of Alabama at Birmingham" to locate the "University of Alabama at Birmingham (HA)" (UAB HA) group.

    ![Globus group page showing search results with University of Alabama at Birmingham (HA) listed](./images/go-uab-ha-group-access/002-groups-search.png)

1. Fill in the form.

    - **Path** defaults to the root of the Collection. This may or may not be acceptable for your use case. Be sure to limit access to only the data that needs to be shared. Use the file browser available in the form to find the correct level of access. For now grant permission to the default.
    - **Share With**: radio buttons to provide control over who to share with. In almost all cases, you will want to share with a single user, which is what we will show here.
        - **User**: Use the "User" search bar to find the specific user you wish to share with. If they have never accessed Globus before, they will not appear in the search results. You can safely enter their email address to add them anyway. For now grant permission to yourself for the purposes of experimenting.
    - **Email Notification** checkbox. We recommend sending an email notification as a convenience.
        - **To** entry field: who to send the email to. We recommend the same person as the "User" selected earlier. There may be future cases where you want to notify others, such as a supervisor, as well.
        - **Message** text entry field: the optional content to send in the email message.
    - **Permissions** The "read" permission must be granted, as that is the point of sharing the Collection. You may additionally give "write" permission to create a two-way collaboration. We recommend Research Cores not grant "write" permission. If you are using a Globus Connect Personal Collection, then "write" permission requires you to correctly [configure your Collection](#how-do-i-choose-specific-folders-to-share-using-globus-connect-personal) to make your shared folder writable.

1. Click the "Add Permission" button to grant permission. You should see a notification confirming the permissions granted. At this point permissions have been granted and the Collection is shared with another person. If you need to add more people, click the "Add another Permision" button and repeat the process. Otherwise click "Done". For now click "Done".

1. When you click "Done" you should be taken back to the Permissions tab of the Customer Share page. You should see a new entry with "Path: /". If you click the drop-down arrow you will see yourself listed with "Read" permission. If you need to revoke permissions, return to this page and click the icon that looks like a trash can.
