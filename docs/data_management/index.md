# Data Management

Proper research data management ensures security, compliance, and operational efficiency, while ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to specific data. Researchers and users of Cheaha are responsible for organizing their data and backing up critical information.

This page provides an overview of the storage options and data transfer tools available for research projects. It also highlights good practices for managing, sharing, and preserving research data, as well as the roles and responsibilities of researchers and research computing teams.

We covered the following topics:

- [Storage Service](./storage/index.md): This section explains the types of storage available, their use cases, and how to access them. We provide multiple storage options for research projects, including:
    - [Cheaha Storage (GPFS)](./storage/cheaha_storage_gpfs/index.md).
    - [UAB LTS](./storage/lts/index.md).
    - [Code Storage](./storage/code_storage.md).
    - [Alternative Storage Options](./storage/alternate_storage.md).
- [Data Transfer Tools](./transfer/index.md): Various tools are available for transferring data to, from, and between our storage systems, including: [Globus](./transfer/globus/index.md), [Rclone](./transfer/rclone.md), and [FileZilla](./transfer/filezilla.md). Step-by-step tutorials for [Globus](./transfer/tutorial/index.md) are also provided to help you transfer data between our storage systems.
- [Research Data Responsibilities](./research_data_responsibilities.md): This section  explains the roles and responsibilities in research data management. It covers the responsibilities of researchers and research computing teams, provides guidelines for managing, sharing, and preserving research data, and describes good practices for handling shared allocations.
