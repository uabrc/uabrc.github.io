title: Storage and Data Transfer
---

Research Storage is a scalable storage fabric designed to grow with your
research operations. Data set sizes are growing dramatically. Keeping
enough storage on hand to manage Big Data is a challenge for everyone.
The Research Storage service provides nearly unlimited capacity to hold
the data important to your research. The service is built using flexible
technologies that can support any research data requirement.

Description of research storage locations and hardware assumes that all
files and data will be placed on Cheaha with the intent of being used
for computation related to a legitimate research need. Compute storage
is not intended for archival or backup purposes, and is not intended to
store personal, non-research and non-educational data. Educational data
should be limited to coursework requiring computational research.
Research Computing does not own any data placed by users on Cheaha.
Backup services are not provided by the Research Computing department
and must be maintained by the data owner.
