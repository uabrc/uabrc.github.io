## UAB Kubernetes Computation Resources

- 4 DGX A100 nodes
    - GPUs arenâ€™t virtualized, but one DGX node can be split into 1/7th of a GPU
    - 8 A100s per DGX node * 7/7ths = 56/7ths of a GPU possible
    - Can be used for classes learning to use GPUs
- Finding containers to use
    - K8s will search DockerHub and other container registries automagically.
    - Can add additional registries
