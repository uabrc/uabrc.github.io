# Managing UAB XIAS Users

UAB XIAS User management allow UAB faculty and staff to grant external collaborators access to specific resources on the internal UAB network. All XIAS users must be connected with at least one site, so you'll need to create one at the [UAB XIAS User Management Webpage](https://idm.uab.edu/cgi-cas/xrmi/sites).

## Discovering and Managing Users

There are two ways to discover XIAS users you are currently sponsoring.
The first is to search by email address. The second is to list all users
associated with a site.

### Discovering Users

1. To locate users by e-mail address: type their email into the "Locate specific user(s) by e-mail address" text field on the "Manage Users" page.

2. To manage users by site: select the site from the drop-down box and click the "List" button. The page will reload with a table containing name, email, and start and end dates. The end date is when the XIAS user registration expires. To change the end date for user(s), click the "Sel" checkbox next to their names, enter a date in the "Change end date for selected users to" text field, and click "Update".
