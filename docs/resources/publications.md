# Grant Descriptions

## Short

> UAB IT Research Computing maintains high performance compute (HPC) and
> storage resources for investigators. The Cheaha high performance
> compute cluster provides 8192 CPU cores and 72 GPUs interconnected via
> an InfiniBand network, providing over 619 TFLOP/s of aggregate
> theoretical peak performance. A high-performance, 12PB raw GPFS
> storage on DDN SFA12KX hardware is also connected to these compute
> nodes via the Infiniband fabric, available to all UAB investigators.
