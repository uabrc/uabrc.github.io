# Create and Manage Code.rc (GitLab) Accounts

UAB Research Computing maintains an on-premises GitLab server, part of the Research Computing System (RCS), called **Code.rc**. Generally speaking, [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a service designed for collaborating on software development projects and is similar in structure and purpose to [GitHub](https://github.com/). In contrast to the Git hosting services [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com) and [GitHub.com](https://github.com), Code.rc is hosted on-premises and stored in a secure physical environment on UAB Campus.

    Code.rc accounts are managed separately from [Research Computing System (RCS) accounts](../rcs/index.md). Before creating a Code.rc account, you must create an RCS account.
