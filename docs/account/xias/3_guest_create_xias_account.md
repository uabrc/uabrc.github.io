# Guest - Creating a XIAS Account

These instructions are for guests who have been registered by UAB faculty and staff to use internal UAB resources. Once a request for a XIAS account has been made by your UAB sponsor, you will need to follow these instructions to complete the XIAS registration and obtain access to UAB resources. All of the links used on this page are available at the [UAB XIAS Guest Users](https://apps.idm.uab.edu/xias/top) page.

## What Do I Need Before Starting?

Before starting, you'll need the following prerequisites.

- A XIAS Sponsor who has completed the [Sponsor phases](./index.md) of XIAS account creation.
- Access to the email address you gave your Sponsor.

## How Do I Create a XIAS Account?

1. After your Sponsor completes their phases, you should receive an email from `UserServices@uab.edu` that looks like the following.

    ![!Screenshot of first email.](_img/xias_guest_001.png)

    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
    ??? note "Email Contents"

        > Subject: UAB online resource access
        >
        > From: UAB Identity Management `<UserServices@uab.edu>`
        >
        > A request has been received to grant you access to the following inline resource(s) at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB):
        >
        > List of XIAS Sites
        >
        > Since you are not a UAB employee or student, you will not have a BlazerID, which is the usual identifier for accessing UAB online resources. Instead, special credentials will be set up for you through UAB's External ID Access Support (XIAS). You should receive a separate e-mail later today with instructions for creating the XIAS password.
        >

1. You should receive a second email from `UserServices@uab.edu` that looks like the following.

    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD046 -->
    ??? note "Email Contents"

        > Subject: UAB External ID (XIAS) registration
        >
        > From: UAB Identity Management `<UserServices@uab.edu>`
        >
        > At the request of a University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) department, you have been authorized as an external user to access one or more UAB online resources.
        >
        > To log in to these resources, you will need to register an External ID Access (XIAS) account. Please follow these instructions to complete the setup of your account.
        >
        > 1. Go to `https://idm.uab.edu/xias`
        > 1. Click on the link for "Enter Invite or Reset Code".
        > 1. On the form, submit your e-mail address (`name@domain.tld`) and the code:
        >
        >     `code here`
        >
        > 1. Provide the requested information on the screens which follow.
        >
        > This code will expire in 72 hours. You must complete your registration before then, or a new code will have to be requested.
        >
        > The person or department who sponsored your access should provide you with separate instructions for accessing the resource(s). Note that since this is a new account, it may take some time for your access to be fully established after the registration is completed.
        >
        > If you have any questions or encounter any difficulties with this process, please contact the AskIT Help Desk at 205.996.5555 or `AskIT@uab.edu`.

## Next Steps

From here, you may create an [RCS Account](../rcs/index.md).

All RCS services require two-factor authentication (2FA) and some require UAB Campus Network VPN access.
